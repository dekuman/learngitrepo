THIS IS THE README
Thats how it would announce itself I believe

This repositiory is one I made to practise git and Github, its something I wanted to learn for a long while, even though ive been using this 'somehow' for the past years and well.. better late than never.

You'll find in this repo all kinds of weird,unconventional files and bizzare things  cause it's basically a playground for me,and I'm quite experimental with the things I learn.

That being said- if you do find this repo, enjoy trying to make sense to it,,, goodluckk
